Project Description:
This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various medical details such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and other health indicators. Using a machine learning model, the goal is to assist early diagnosis, especially for patients at risk.

The dataset used is typically the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains health data collected from female patients of Pima Indian heritage. By training models on this data, we can identify patterns and factors most associated with diabetes.

This kind of prediction system can be a valuable tool for doctors, clinics, or health apps to help flag at-risk individuals and promote early testing and treatment.

Key Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing or skewed data
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand correlations between features
Building and testing various classification models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
Optional: Feature importance visualization to understand which health metrics impact prediction the most

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy for data handling)
Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation
Jupyter Notebook for development and results

Outcome:
The final model predicts the presence of diabetes with high accuracy and provides insights into the most significant health indicators. This project showcases how machine learning can be applied in healthcare to support preventive care and early detection.
